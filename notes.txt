---------- App Improvements ----------

- Input visuals
    - once you enter the app I'm fine with the 3 menu options being in the center but once you go into one of the
    three menus it should push the next set of options to the left side of the window to leave room for information to
    be displayed in the middle and right sections of the window
    - maybe the input box pop out for adding flight, passenger and booking stays the same but the displays of the other
    functions should use up that extra screen space to better display the information as opposed to a pop out that
    is a little small once you start to scale up


----- PHASE 2 -----
- Implement a simple database
    - will have to do some research on this one but I think this feature will be very important


----- PHASE 3 -----
- Develop a user manuel
    - this will be more towards the end of this project once we get all the features finalized
